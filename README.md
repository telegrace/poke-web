**Where did you get the Pok√©mon List?**
There wasn't a list of Pokemon readily available in an easily consumable format, so a list was gathered from [Pokemon Fandom](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Generation_I_Pok%C3%A9mon) and then manipulated to create a JSON file with beautiful soup. You can see the code under the `beautiful-soup` folder.
